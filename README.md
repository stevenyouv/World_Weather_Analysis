## Retrieve Weather Data
The objective of retrieving weather data was to utlize the skill of performing an API call with the OpenWeatherMap to generate a set of random coordinates and retrieve their respective nearest cities.  API skills were also used to retrieve current weather descriptions for each city which was then organized into a DataFrame.

## Create a Customer Travel Destinations Map
The purpose of creating a customer travel destinations map was to create input satements to retrieve customer weather preferences and then use those preferences to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels.  We also utilized the ability to add data to pop up markers to show the destinations on a marker layer map.  


## Create a Travel Itinerary Map
In creating a travel itenerary map, we utilized Google Directions API to create a travel itinerary that displayed the routes between 4 different nearby cities.  A marker layer map was again created with pop-up markers for each city.
